<h1> Why Is He My Hero? </h1>
Kanye West is my hero for many reasons. To begin with, Kanye has gone through so many ups and downs throughout his life, but continues to produce music for his fans. He has been in terrible car accident, faced brutal scrutany, and battles being Bi-polar every day. Despite this however, Kanye shows true perserverance and never gave up on music and his fans. I think that Kanyes hard work and perserverance is truly admiral. Furthermore, I respect Kanye,because despite his huge musical career, he has found the time to raise a beautiful family. I truly respect Kanye due to his vast variety of positive attributes.
